Chatbot Application Documentation

Overview
────────
This Flask-based chatbot application is designed to provide interactive conversational AI responses. It integrates two main components: an AI engine for generating responses and a RAG data processor to query contextual or supplementary information. The application has been structured to eventually support multiple users, though the current implementation is optimized for a single user session.

Key Features
────────────
• Web-based interface served using Flask.
• AI engine integration for generating dynamic responses.
• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data querying based on user inputs.
• Markdown support to format and display chatbot responses.
• Initial setup accommodates multiple user sessions (future implementation), with current functionality targeting a single user.

Application Structure
─────────────────────
1. app.py
   - Imports:
     • Flask and related modules (render_template, request, jsonify, session)
     • AI engine functionality from ai_engine (ai_response)
     • RAG data querying from ragdata (rag_query)
     • Markdown conversion using markdown2.
   - Flask App Setup:
     • Instantiates the Flask application with a session secret key.
     • Contains routes to render the chat interface and process chat messages.
   - Endpoints:
     a. “/” (GET):
        • Renders the homepage (index.html) for user interaction.
     b. “/chat” (POST):
        • Receives user messages in JSON format.
        • Processes the message by querying RAG data with an identifier ("RadheKrishna").
        • Constructs an enhanced user message that includes both the original text and fetched RAG data, formatted for clarity.
        • Maintains a conversation history with roles (“user” and “model”) and their respective message parts.
        • Calls the AI engine (ai_response) to generate a response.
        • Converts the AI-generated response from plain text to Markdown.
        • Returns the Markdown-formatted reply as a JSON response.
   - Comments within the code highlight that while the groundwork for handling multiple users exists, the current implementation is simplified for single-user interaction.

Setup and Installation
────────────────────────
1. Prerequisites:
   • Python 3.x installed on your system.
   • pip package manager.

2. Required Python Libraries:
   • Flask
   • markdown2
   • (Custom modules) ai_engine and ragdata – ensure these are available in your project.

3. Installation Steps:
   a. Clone or download the repository containing the application code.
   b. Install the dependencies:
      pip install Flask markdown2
      (Ensure ai_engine and ragdata modules are also installed or available in your project path.)

Running the Application
────────────────────────
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute app.py:
      python app.py
3. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the chatbot interface.

API Usage
─────────
• GET / 
  - Description: Loads the homepage (index.html) for interacting with the chatbot.
  
• POST /chat
  - Description: Processes a user’s chat input.
  - Request Body:
    • JSON object containing the key “message” with the user’s input text.
  - Processing Workflow:
    1. Extracts the user message.
    2. Queries the RAG system using the user message and a hard-coded identifier (“RadheKrishna”).
    3. Constructs a detailed log combining the original message and the RAG-provided data.
    4. (Internally) Maintains a conversation history with “user” and “model” roles.
    5. Calls the AI engine to generate a reply.
    6. Converts the reply from plain text to Markdown format.
  - Response:
    • Returns a JSON object with a “reply” key containing the Markdown-formatted response.

Customization and Future Enhancements
─────────────────────────────────────────
• User Session Management: Although the application includes code logic to support multiple users via Flask sessions, the present usage scenario is limited to single-user operation. Future updates may expand upon this for robust multi-user interactions.
• Module Extensions: The ai_engine and ragdata modules can be further customized to improve AI response quality and contextual data retrieval.

Conclusion
──────────
This chatbot application leverages modern web technologies, AI response generation, and RAG-based contextual querying to deliver an engaging conversational experience. The clear separation of responsibilities across modules helps ensure that the system is both maintainable and extensible. Future enhancements will likely target improved multi-user handling and enriched integration capabilities.
